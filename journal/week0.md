#### Step 3, Create AWS account with MFA

- I created an  AWS user account (different from the root user) with full administrative permission and MFA setup
- A programatic access was created to use for access via the command line of my local machine or VS code


### Step 4, Install  AWS CLI V2 on my local Machine and on setup and auto installation on the gitpod.yml file
I was able to install aws CLi v2 on my local machine using the below command.

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

It was successful and i got the below output.

I was setup the aws cli installation to start 

Tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
vscode:
  extensions:
    - 42Crunch.vscode-openapi
